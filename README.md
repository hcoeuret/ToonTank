# ToonTank - 3D Action Game

This game was made as a way to deepen my unreal knowledge by implementing UI, AI, sound and special effects features in a third person mini tank game.

## Setup 

Clone the repo and launch it through the unreal editor. You can also generate the exe file and play it directly on your computer

## The game

In this game, you control a tank with your arrow keys and shoot with your left mouse button. You win the game by killing all the turrets on the map. Don't get killed first :)

Good luck and have fun !
